Project Components
This project consists of three core components:

Excel Financial Model (Solar Project Finance Model.xlsx): A comprehensive 25-year financial model built from scratch. It includes a full debt schedule, accelerated depreciation, 3-statement financials, and calculation of key return metrics like Equity IRR and NPV.

Power BI Dashboard (Solar Project Dashboard.pbix): An interactive one-page dashboard designed to provide an at-a-glance overview of the project's financial health. It visualizes key performance indicators, cash flows, and operational profitability over the project's lifetime.

Investment Memorandum (Investment Memorandum.pdf): A professional investment proposal that synthesizes the financial analysis into a compelling business case. It outlines the project's viability, financial projections, and risk analysis, making a clear recommendation for equity investment.
